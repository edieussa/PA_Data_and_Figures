# Non-contact photoacoustic imaging with a silicon photonics-based Laser Doppler Vibrometer 
This repository contains data and analysis for the research paper titled "Non-contact photoacoustic imaging with a silicon photonics-based Laser Doppler Vibrometer" by Emiel Dieussaert, Roel Baets, Hilde Jans, Xavier Rottenberg, and Yanlu Li.

## About the Project
Photoacoustic imaging is a non-invasive imaging modality beneficial for various biomedical applications. This repository contains the data collected and analyzed in the cited paper, which introduces a novel approach to photoacoustic imaging using a silicon photonics-based Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV) for non-contact detection of acoustic waves.

## Key Innovations
The development of a compact, non-contact method for detecting photoacoustic signals using a Laser Doppler Vibrometer.
Reconstruction of 2D photoacoustic images of silicone samples embedded with ink-filled channels, simulating tissue with blood-carrying veins.
The detection of photoacoustic signals with absorption coefficients within the physiological range using a compact pulsed laser diode.
